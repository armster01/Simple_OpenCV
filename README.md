# Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV

A simple project to detect faces and eyes in images or video streams using OpenCV and Haar cascades.

# Features

1. Detect faces and eyes in real-time using your webcam or input images.
2. Highlights detected regions with rectangles.
3. Prerequisites
4. Python 3.x
5. OpenCV library

# How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install opencv-python.
3. Download and place the Haar cascade XML files for face and eye detection in the project directory.
4. Run the script: python face_and_eye_detection.py.

# Example

The script displays rectangles around detected faces (blue) and eyes (green) in the video feed or image.

# Future Enhancements

Support for detecting other facial features.
Integration with deep learning models for improved accuracy.
